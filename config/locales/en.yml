      ##What is secondary content?

      Secondary content is content which is not linked to in the step by step, but has the step by step sidebar showing on it.

      We use it for content which:

      - helps you to complete a task in the journey, but is not the primary piece of content you need to visit to complete that task
      - is optional and not useful enough to be included in the step by step

        label: Base Path
        hint: "For example: https://www.gov.uk/pay-vat or /bank-holidays"
