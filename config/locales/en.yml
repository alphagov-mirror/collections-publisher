        guidance_title: "Describing a step"
        guidance: |
          A step can be a task or a group of related tasks. A task is an action the user needs to do, for example Check if you need to apply for a licence. Link the whole sentence - not just the action - and do not add a full stop.

          Start a step with an action and keep it short, for example ‘Check what age you can drive’.

          [The content patterns guidance](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MS/pages/416317515/Step+and+task+content+patterns)

          ### Formatting

          Links should be task focused. You cannot link only part of a sentence.

          `[Task name](/link)`

          For example: `[book your theory test](/book-theory-test)`

          Only use bullets to show different ways you can perform the same task or different variables that change how you complete the task. Do not use bullets to list tasks that are all essential

          `- [download option 1](/link)`
          `- [download option 2](/link)`

  secondary_content_links:
    guidance_markdown: |
      ##What is secondary content?

      Secondary content is content which is not linked to in the step by step, but has the step by step sidebar showing on it.

      We use it for content which:

      - could help you complete a task but is not the main piece of content included in the step by step
      - is optional and not useful enough to be included in the step by step
    index:
      base_path:
        label: Add new secondary link
        hint: "For example: https://www.gov.uk/pay-vat or /bank-holidays"
