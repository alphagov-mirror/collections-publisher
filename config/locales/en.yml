          A step can be a task or a group of related tasks. A task is an action the user needs to do, for example: Check if you need to apply for a licence. Link the whole sentence - not just the action - and do not add a full stop.

          Start a step with an action and keep it short, for example: ‘Check what age you can drive’.

          [The content patterns guidance](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MS/pages/416317515/Step+and+task+content+patterns)

          ### Formatting

          Links should be task focused. You cannot link only part of a sentence.

          `[Task name](/link)`

          For example: `[book your theory test](/book-theory-test)`

          Only use bullets to show different ways you can perform the same task or different variables that change how you complete the task. Do not use bullets to list tasks that are all essential

      ## Showing or hiding the sidebar

      ### Always show navigation

      Sidebar will always show on the piece of content. Choose this option if the content is about a task that is always completed as part of the step by step journey. For example, booking a theory driving test is always part of the wider journey of learning to drive.

      ### Show navigation if users comes from step by step

      Sidebar will only show if you clicked on a link in the step by step to get there For example: If the page is part of multiple user journeys and showing step by steps risks limiting the way the page is used'.

      ### Never show navigation

      Chose this option when you're linking to a page that it would never be appropriate for the step by step side bar to appear on.
